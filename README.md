# bobo 🐶
Simple website created to track who took my dog Bobo outside. 

Yes - tracking who did it is very important. :smirk:

## Running
Nodejs is required to run the backend.

Run this to run frontend and backend:

```shell
cd bobo
node bin/www
```

Yay, Bobo tracking is now running at `localhost:3000`! Track that dawg.
